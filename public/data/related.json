        "description": "Gerçekler mutlu etmez. Ancak mutsuzluğun ve hayatın gerçeklerinin harekete geçirici etkisi vardır. Behçet Yalın Özkara eğitimin mutluluk getireceğine inandı. Bu nedenle ESOGÜ İşletmeden lisans ve doktora, Hacettepe’den Yüksek Lisans, Anadolu İktisattan lisans, Dış ticaret ve Halkla ilişkilerden ise önlisans diplomalarını aldı. Ancak elde ettiği mutluluk çok kısa sürdü. Bu sefer, Yurtdışında eğitim görerek mutluluğu yakalayacağına inandı. Seul Hanyang, Massachusetts ve Michigan üniversitelerinde bulundu. Yine olmadı. Ardından şöhret belki beni mutlu eder diye umdu. Akademiklink isimli bir youtube kanalı açtı. Behçet Yalın Özkara believed that education would lead him to happiness. For this reason, he pursued education and received several degrees; bachelor's degree and Phd. in Business at ESOGU, master at Hacettepe, bachelor's degree in Economics and associate degree in Foreign Trade and Public Relations at Anadolu University. However, the happiness he achieved didn't last long. This time, he thought he would find happiness by studying abroad. Then he's been at Hanyang University of Seoul, University of Massachusettes and University of Michigan. Happiness didn't happen again. Then he thought fame might bring him happiness. So he started a Youtube Channel named \"Akademiklink\". He is still unhappy but has full faith that someday he will be happy. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",
